# REU-Writeup

Columbia 2021 REU research into estimating Hurst indices of fBM with noise.

Note: The ```fbm1b.m``` file used to generate fractional Brownian motion is the work of Zdravko Botev; a copy of the original's license has been added to the file in compliance.
This is not completely my own work. The code in this project is collaborately created by the Columbia 2021 REU research group led by Prof. Carsten Chong.
